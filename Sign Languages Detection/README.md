# What are Sign Languages

`It is a mode of communication that does not rely on the use of spoken words but rather on non-verbal cues such as hand gestures and movements, body language, and facial expressions. Those who are deaf or hard of hearing typically communicate through the use of sign languages. Sign Languages are natural human languages that have developed wherever communities of deaf people have come together to form groups. Sign Languages are spoken by around 35 million people worldwide. Sign languages are fully developed human languages that are on a par with spoken languages at every level of linguistic organisation. This means that, just like spoken languages, sign languages have their own grammar and lexicon.`

**We will take a look at 2 sign languages in this notebook**

- **ISL (Indian Sign Language)**
- **ASL (American Sign Language)**

`Whereas the Alphabetical Signs for both of them are distinct, the Digits are identical and are represented as the same. We will also examine this notebook for instances in which the Digits do not differ.`

## About the Dataset

This is a American Sign Language Digits Dataset, from sign 0 to sign 9. This dataset uses depth information for generating hand key-points (using MediaPipe), which enriches the dataset and enhances the accuracy during classification.
